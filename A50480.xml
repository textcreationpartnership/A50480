            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>My deſign herein is that the formal <pb facs="tcp:95530:8"/>ſleepy profeſſor may be awakened, and the cloſe Hypocrite diſcovered; but my fear is, that weak beleivers may be hereby diſcouraged: for as it is hard to ſhew how low a Child of God may fall in ſin, and yet have true grace, but that the ſinner will be apt thereupon to preſume; ſo it is as hard to ſhew how high a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may riſe in a profeſſion, and yet have no grace, but that the beleiver will be apt thereupon to deſpond. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention whereof I have carefully indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, by ſhewing, that though a man may go thus far, and yet be but <hi>almoſt a Chriſtian,</hi> yet a man may fall ſhort of this, and be a true Chriſtian notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; judge not therefore thy ſtate by any one character thou findeſt laid down of a falſe profeſſor, but read the whole and then make a judgement, for I have cared,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.26.</note> as not to give <hi>childrens bread to Dogs,</hi> ſo not to uſe the Dog-Whip to ſcare the children: yet I could wiſh that this book might fall into the hands of ſuch onely whom it chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, who <hi>have a name to live,</hi>

And the Lord follow it with his bleſſing wherever it comes, that it may be an awakening word to all ſuch, and eſpecially to that generation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate profeſſors (with which this age abounds) who, if they keep to their Church, bow the knee, tale out a few prayers, and at a good time receive the Sacrament; think they do enough for Heaven, and hereupon judge their condition ſafe, and their Salvation ſure, though their be a hell of ſin in their hearts,<note place="margin">Ro. 3.13.</note> 
               <hi>and the Poyſon of Aſps under their lips,</hi> their minds being as yet carnal and unconverted, and their converſations filthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified: if eternal life be of ſo eaſie attainment, and to be had at ſo cheap a rate of devotion, it is to me a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what our Lord Chriſt meant to tell us,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.14.</note>

               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10</note> certainly therefore it is <pb facs="tcp:95530:9"/>no ſuch eaſie thing to be ſaved, as many make it, and that thou wilt ſee plainly in the following diſcourſe: I have been ſomewhat ſhort in the application of it, and therefore let me here be thy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer in five important duties.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7.16 verſ. 27.</note>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 6.25.</note>Firſt, <hi>Take heed of reſting in a form of godlineſs,</hi> as if duties <hi>ex opere operato</hi> could confer grace; a lifeleſs formality is advanced to a very high eſteem in the World, as a <hi>Kab of Doves Dung,</hi> was ſold in the Famine of <hi>Samaria,</hi> at a very dear rate. Alas the profeſſion of godlineſs is but a ſandy foundation, to build the hope of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul upon for eternity, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Lord Jeſus Chriſt called him a fooliſh builder, <hi>that founded his houſe upon the ſand,</hi> and the ſad event proved him ſo, <hi>for it fell, and great was the fall of it.</hi> Oh therefore lay thy foundations by faith upon the Rock Chriſt Jeſus,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11.</note> look to Chriſt through all, and reſt upon Chriſt in all.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:95530:10"/>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Labour to ſee an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the power of godlineſs,</hi> a beauty in the life of grace; if the means of grace have a lovelineſs in them, ſurely grace it ſelf hath much more, for <hi>finis dat amabilitatem mediis</hi> the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the means lies in its ſutableneſs and ſerviceableneſs to the end, the form of godlineſs hath no goodneſs in it, any farther then it ſteads and becomes uſeful to the ſoul in the power and practiſe of godlineſs. The life of holineſs is the onely excellent life, it is the life of Saints and Angels in Heaven, yea it is the life of God himſelf. As it is a great proof of the baſeneſs and filthineſs of ſin, that ſinners ſeek to cover it, ſo it is a great proof of the excellency of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that ſo many pretend to it; The very Hypocrites fair profeſſion pleads the cauſe of Religion, although the Hypocrite is then really worſt, when he is ſeemingly beſt.<note place="margin">Malus ubi bonum ſe ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And this was the great charge they had againſt him, that of a great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer he was become a great profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</p>

            <p>This is the breviat and ſum of <hi>Pauls</hi> defence and plea for himſelf; which you find in the ſequel of the Chapter, had a different effect upon his Judges.</p>

               <p>But now in Scripture, the word is of a more ſtrict and narrow acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is uſed onely to denominate the true Diſciples and followers of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.26. <hi>The Diſciples were firſt called Chriſtians at</hi> Antioch, 1 Pet. 4.16. <hi>If any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed,</hi> that is as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Diſciple of Chriſt, and ſo in the Text, <hi>Almoſt thou perſwadeſt me to be a Chriſtian.</hi>

               <p>The Goſpel doth not ſpeak theſe things to wound beleivers, but to awaken ſinners and formal profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>
               <p>As there are none more averſe then weak beleivers to apply the promiſes, and comforts of the Goſpel to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for whom they are properly deſigned;</p>
               <p>So there are none more ready then they to apply the threats and ſevereſt things of the Word to themſelves, for whom they were never intended.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 16, 15</note>As the Diſciples, when Chriſt told them, <hi>one of you ſhall betray me,</hi> they that were innocent, ſuſpected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt, and therefore cry out <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is it I?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So weak Chriſtians, when they hear ſinners reproved, or the Hypocrite laid open, in the Miniſtry of the word, they preſently cry out, <hi>it is I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the Hypocrites fault to ſit under the tryals and diſcoveries of the Word, and yet not to mind them.</p>

               <p>And it is the weak Chriſtians fault to draw ſad concluſions of their own ſtate from premiſes which nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them.</p>
               <p>There is indeed great uſe of ſuch Doctrine as this is, to all beleivers.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Sol.</note>It is true, that where the ſoul for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes ſin from a right principle, after a right manner, to a right end; where he forſakes ſin as ſin, as being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God, and the purity of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>This declares that Soul to be right with God, and the promiſe ſhall be made good to it, <hi>he ſhall finde mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now pray mind, there is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking ſin that is not right but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Open ſins may be deſerted, and yet ſecret ſins may be retained; now this is not a right forſaking, ſuch a ſoul ſhall never finde mercy: A man may be cured of a wound in his fleſh, and yet may die of an impoſtume in his bowels.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A man may forſake ſin but not as ſin; for he that forſakes ſin as ſin, <pb n="58" facs="tcp:95530:50"/>forſakes all ſin; <hi>à quatenus ad omne valet conſequentia:</hi> It is impoſſible for a man to forſake ſin as ſin, unleſs he forſakes all that he knows to be ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A man may let one ſin go to hold another the faſter; as a man that goes to ſea, would willingly ſave all his goods, but if the ſtorm ariſes that he cannot, then he throws ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board to lighten the veſſel, and ſave the reſt. So did they <hi>Acts</hi> 27.38.</p>
               <p>So the ſinner chuſes to keep all his ſins, but if a ſtorm ariſes in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, why then he will heave one luſt overboard to ſave the life of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A man may let all ſin go, and yet be a ſinner ſtill; for there is the root of all ſin in the heart though the fruit be not ſeen in the life; the tree lives, though the boughs be lopt off</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 51.5.</note>As a man is a ſinner before ever he acts ſin, ſo (till grace renew him) he is a ſinner though he leaves ſin, for there is original ſin in him enough to damn and deſtroy him.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Sin may be left and yet be loved, a man may forſake the life of ſin and yet retain the love of ſin; now though leaving ſin makes him almoſt a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, yet loving ſin ſhews he is but almoſt a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>It is a leſs evil to do ſin and not love it, then to love ſin and not do it; for to do ſin may argue onely weakneſs of Grace, but to love ſin argues ſtrength of luſt; <hi>What I hate that do I,</hi> Rom. 7.15.</p>
               <p>Sin is bad in any part of man, but ſin in the affection is worſe then ſin in the converſation; for ſin in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation may be onely from infirmity, but ſin in the affection is the fruit of choyce and unregeneracy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All ſin may be chained and yet the heart not changed, and ſo the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſinner is the ſame as ever. A dog chained up is a dog ſtill, as much as if he was let looſe to devour.</p>
               <p>There may be a ceſſation of arms between enemies, and yet the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel may remain on foot ſtill; there may be a making Truce where there is no making Peace.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:95530:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>A Sinner may lay the weapons of ſin out of his hand, and yet the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt God ſtill remain in his heart.</p>
               <p>There may be a truce, he may not ſin againſt him; but there can be no peace till he be united unto him.</p>
               <p>Reſtraining Grace holds in the Sinner, but it is Renewing Grace that changes the Nature; Now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are held in by Grace from being open Sinners, that are not renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Grace, and made true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</p>
               <p>Now then if a man may forſake open ſins, and retain ſecret ſins; if he may forſake ſin, but not as ſin; if he may let one ſin go to hold an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other the faſter; if a man may let all ſin go and yet be a ſinner ſtill; if ſin may be left and yet be loved; Finally, if all ſin may be chained, and yet the heart not changed, then a man may forſake ſin, and yet be <hi>but almoſt a Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>A man may hate ſin, and yet be but almoſt a Chriſtian, Abſalom</hi> 
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:95530:51"/>hated <hi>Amnons</hi> uncleanneſs,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 13 22, 28.</note> with his Siſter <hi>Thamar,</hi> yea, his hatred was ſo great, as that he ſlew him for it, and yet <hi>Abſalom</hi> was but a wicked man.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Object</note>But the Scripture makes it a ſign of a gracious heart to hate ſin, yea though a man do, through infirmity, fall into ſin, yet if he hates it, this is a proof of grace. <hi>Paul</hi> proves the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his heart, and the truth of his grace by this hatred of ſin, though he committed it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. <hi>what I hate, that do I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay what is grace but <hi>conformitas cum archetypo,</hi> a conformity of the ſoul to God, to love as God loves, to hate as God hates, now God hates ſin, it is one part of his holineſs, to hate all ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sol.</note>And if I hate ſin, then am I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to God, and if I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to God, then am I altogether a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>It is true, that there is a hatred of ſin which is a ſign of grace, and which flows from a principle of grace, and is grace, as for inſtance.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:95530:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>To hate ſin, as it is an offence to God, a wrong to his Majeſty; to hate ſin, as it is a breach of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſo a wicked controuling Gods will, which is the onely rule of goodneſs, to hate ſin, as being a diſ-ingenuous tranſgreſſion of that law of love eſtabliſhed in the blood and death of Chriſt, and ſo in a degree <hi>a crucifying of Chriſt afreſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To hate ſin as being a greiving and quenching the Spirit of God, as all ſin in its nature is.</p>
               <p>Thus to hate ſin is grace, and thus every true Chriſtian hates ſin.</p>
               <p>But though every man that hath grace, hates ſin, yet every man that hates ſin hath not grace. For,</p>
               <p>A man may hate ſin from other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, not as it is a wrong to God, or a wounding Chriſt, or a greiving the Spirit, for then he would hate all ſin, for there is no ſin but hath this in the nature of it. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man may hate ſin for the ſhame that attends it, more then for the evil that is in it.</p>
               <p>Some ſinners there are who <hi>declare <pb n="63" facs="tcp:95530:52"/>their ſin as</hi> Sodom, <hi>and hide it not.</hi>

                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19.</p>
               <p>But now others there are who are aſhamed of ſin, and therefore hate it, not for the ſins ſake, but the ſhames ſake. This made <hi>Abſalom</hi> hate <hi>Amnons</hi> uncleanneſs, becauſe it brought ſhame upon him and his Siſter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A man may hate ſin more in others then in himſelf, ſo doth the Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, he hates drunkenneſs in another, and yet practiſes it himſelf; The Lyar hates falſe-hood in another, but likes it in himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now he that hates ſin from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of grace, hates ſin moſt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he hates ſin in others, but he loaths moſt the ſins of his own heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A man may hate one ſin, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to another; There is a great contrariety between ſin and ſin, between luſt and luſt: It is rhe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the life of grace, that it is a uniforme life, there is no one grace contrary to another, the graces of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95530:53"/>Gods Spirit are different, but not differing; faith, and love, and holineſs are all one, they conſiſt together at the ſame time, in the ſame ſubject, nay they can't be parted, there can be no faith without love, no love without holineſs, and ſo on the other hand, no holineſs without love, no love without faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 3.3.</note>So that this makes the life of grace an eaſie and excellent life, but now the life of ſin is a diſtracting contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, wherein a man is a ſervant to contrary luſts, the luſt of pride and prodigality is contrary to the luſt of covetouſneſs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now when one luſt gets to be the Maſter luſt in the ſoul, then that works a hatred of its contrary, where covetouſneſs gets the heart, there the heart hates pride, and where pride gets uppermoſt in the heart, there the heart hates covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Thus a man may hate ſin not from a principle of grace, but from the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of luſt.</p>
               <p>He don't hate any ſin as it is ſin, but he hates it as being contrary to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſin.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is a hope that is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the promiſe, as there can be no true faith without a promiſe, ſo nor any true hope; faith applies the promiſe, and hope expects the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the promiſe; faith relies upon the truth of it, and hope waits for <pb n="84" facs="tcp:95530:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>the good of it; faith gives intereſt, hope expects livery and ſeiſin.</p>

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is a hope that is wrought by God himſelf in the ſoul, who is therefore called <hi>the God of hope,</hi> as being the Author as well as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1.27.</note>Now he that hath this hope ſhall never miſcarry, this is a right hope, the hope of the true beleiver, <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, as there is a true and ſound hope, ſo there is a falſe and rotten hope, and this is much more common, as baſtard pearls are more frequently worn then true pearls.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more common then to ſee men big with groundleſs hopes of Heaven, As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man may have great hope, that hath no grace, you read of the hope of Hypocrites, <hi>Job</hi> 8.13, 14.</p>
               <p>The performance of duties is a proof of their hope; the fooliſh Virgins would never have done what they did, had they thought they ſhould have been ſhut out after all.</p>
               <p>Many profeſſors would not be at <pb n="85" facs="tcp:95530:63"/>ſuch pains in duties as they are, if they did not hope for Heaven.</p>
               <p>Hope is the great motive to action, deſpair cuts the ſinews of all indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; that is one reaſon why the damned in hell ceaſe acting toward an alteration of their ſtate, becauſe deſpair hath taken hold of them; if there were any hope in Hell, they would up and be doing there.</p>
               <p>So that there may be great hope where there is no grace, experience proves this; formal profeſſors are men of no grace, but yet men of great hopes; nay many times you ſhall find that none fear more about their eternal condition, then they that have moſt cauſe of hope, and none hope more then they that have moſt cauſe of fear.</p>
               <p>As intereſt in God may ſometimes be without hope, ſo hope in God may be without intereſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A man may hope in the mercy and goodneſs, and power of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eying the promiſe, and this is the hope of moſt, God is full of mercy and goodneſs, and therefore willing <pb n="86" facs="tcp:95530:64"/>to ſave; and he is infinite in power, and therefore able to ſave; why therefore ſhould I not reſt on him?</p>
               <p>Now it is preſumption and therefore ſin to hope in the mercy of God, otherwiſe then by eying the promiſe; for the promiſe is the Channel of mercy, the Pipe through which it is conveyed; all the bleſſedneſs the Saints injoy in Heaven, is no other then what is the fruit of the promiſe relyed on, and hoped for here on Earth.</p>
               <p>A man hath no warrant to hope in God, but by vertue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A man may hope for Heaven, and yet not cleanſe his heart, not depart from his ſecret ſins; that hope of Salvation that is not accompanied with heart-purification, that is a vain hope.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A man may hope for Heaven, and yet be doing the work of Hell; he may hope for ſalvation, and yet be working out his own dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſo periſh in his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:95530:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>This is the caſe of many, <hi>male agendo ſperant, &amp; ſperando pereunt,</hi> like the Water-man, that looks one way, and rows another; many have their eyes on Heaven, whoſe hearts are in the Earth; they hope in God, but chuſe him not for a portion; they hope in God, but do not love him as the beſt good, and the refore are like to have no portion in him, nor good by him, but are like to periſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, notwithſtanding all their hopes. <hi>Job</hi> 27.8. <hi>What is the hope of the Hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God takes away his ſoul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then if a man may have great hope of Heaven that hath no grace, if he may hope in mercy without eying the promiſe, if he may hope without heart purifying, if he may hope for Heaven, and yet do the work of Hell, ſurely then a man may have great hopes of Heaven, and yet be but almoſt a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>A man may be under great and viſible changes, and theſe wrought by the Miniſtry of the Word, and yet be but almoſt a Chriſtian. Herod</hi> was, it is ſaid, <pb n="88" facs="tcp:95530:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>when <hi>he heard John Baptiſt,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now was not this a work of grace? and was not <hi>Saul</hi> here truely conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? one would think he was; but yet indeed he was not?</p>
               <p>For though it is ſaid, God gave him <hi>another heart,</hi> yet it is not ſaid that God gave him a <hi>new heart.</hi>

               </p>

               <p>But now you muſt know that every change is not this change. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a civil change, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral change, as well as a ſpiritual and ſupernatural change.</p>
               <p>Many men are changed in a moral ſenſe, and one may ſay, they are become <hi>new men,</hi> but they are in heart and nature the ſame men ſtill; They are not changed in a ſpiritual, and ſupernatural ſenſe, and therefore it cannot be ſaid of them, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>new creatures.</hi>

               <p>Reſtraining grace may cauſe a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral change, but it is renewing grace that muſt cauſe a ſaving change.</p>

               <p n="3">3. A man may be converted from a courſe of prophaneſs, to a form of godlineſs, from a filthy converſation, to a fair profeſſion, and yet the heart the ſame, in one and the other.</p>

               <p>Many are hot and high againſt the ſins of others, and yet cannot ſee the ſame in themſelves, like the <hi>Lamiae,</hi> that put on their ſpectacles when they went abroad, but pulled them off within doors.</p>
               <p>It is eaſie to ſee fault in others, and as hard to ſee then in our ſelves. <hi>Jehu</hi> was zealous againſt <hi>Baal</hi> and his Prieſts, becauſe that was <hi>Ahabs</hi> ſin, but not againſt the Calves of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> becauſe that was his own ſin.</p>

                  <hi>faith of Gods elect.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 1.1.</note> But then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a common faith not ſaving, a fading and temporary faith, there is the faith of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> as well as the faith of <hi>Simon Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 8 13 &amp; v. 23. compar.</note> 
                  <hi>Simon Magus</hi> beleived, and yet was <hi>in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22 32.</note>Firſt, The faith of moſt is but a <hi>temporary faith,</hi> it dures for a while, and then dies and periſheth, true and ſaving faith, ſuch as is the <hi>faith of Gods elect,</hi> cannot die, it may fail in the Act, but not in the habit; the ſap may not be in the branch, but it is always in the root.</p>
               <p>That faith that periſheth, that faith a man may have and periſh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a faith that lies onely in generals, not in particulars, as there is a general and particular object of faith, ſo there is a general and particular faith. The general ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <pb n="125" facs="tcp:95530:83"/>of faith is the whole Scripture, the particular object of faith is Chriſt in the promiſe.</p>
               <p>Now many have a general faith, to beleive all the Scripture, and yet have no faith to make a particlar ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Jeſus Chriſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>Devils and Reprobates may beleive the truth of the Scripture and what is written of the dying and ſuffering of Chriſt for ſinners, but there are but few that can cloſe up themſelves in the wounds of Chriſt, and by his ſtripes fetch in healing to their ſouls.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is a faith that is ſeated in the underſtanding, but not in the will, this is a very common faith, many aſſent to the truth.</p>
               <p>They beleive all the attributes of God, that he is juſt, holy, wiſe, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, good, merciful, &amp;c. But yet they reſt not on him notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>They beleive the Commands are true, but yet do not obey them; they beleive the promiſes are true, but yet do not imbrace and apply
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95530:84"/>them, they beleive the threatnings are true, but yet do not fly from them.</p>
               <p>Thus their faith lies in aſſent, but not conſent; they have faith to confeſs a judgment, but none to take out execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by aſſent they lay a foundation, but never build upon it by application.</p>
               <p>They believe that Chriſt died to ſave them that beleive, and yet they beleive not in Chriſt that they may be ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ro. 10 10. 1 Cor. 15.17.</note>Oh my brethren it is not a <hi>beleiving head,</hi> but a <hi>beleiving heart</hi> that makes a Chriſtian: <hi>VVith the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leives to righteouſneſs;</hi> without this <hi>our faith is vain, we are yet in our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is a faith without experience, many beleeve the Word upon hearſay to be the word of God, but they never felt the power and vertue of it upon their hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
               <p>Now what good is it to beleive the <hi>truth</hi> of the Word, if a mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence never felt the <hi>power</hi> of the word? what is it to beleeve the <hi>truth</hi> 
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:95530:84"/>of the promiſe, if we never taſted the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of the promiſe?</p>
               <p>We are in this caſe like a man that beleeves the deſcription others make of ſtrange Countreys, but never tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled them to know the truth; or as a Patient that beleives all the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician ſays, but yet trys none of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>We beleeve the word, becauſe we cannot gainſay it, but yet we have no experience of any ſaving good wrought by the Word, and ſo are but <hi>almoſt Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, There is a faith that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out brokenneſs of heart, that doth not avail to melt or ſoften the heart, and therefore is not true faith, for the leaſt true faith is ever joyned with a bending will, and a broken heart.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, There is a faith that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms not the heart; Faith without fruit, that doth not bring forth the New creature in the ſoul, but leaves it in a ſtate of ſin and death.</p>
               <p>This is a faith that makes a man a <hi>fond Profeſſor,</hi> but not a <hi>ſound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever;</hi> 
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:95530:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>he beleives the truth,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.21.</note> but not <hi>as it is in Jeſus,</hi> for then it would change and transform him into the likeneſs of Jeſus.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6.4.</note>Now then if a mans faith may be but temporary, or may lie onely in generals, or may be ſeated in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding onely, or may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out experience, or may be without a broken heart, or without a new heart, ſurely then, a man may have faith, he may <hi>taſte of this heavenly gift,</hi> and yet be but <hi>almoſt a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>

               <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Iam 2.2, 3.</note> A man may love a Saint for his outward greatneſs and ſplendor in the world, men are very apt to honour worldly greatneſs: And therefore the <hi>rich Saint</hi> ſhall be loved and honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whilſt the <hi>poor Saint</hi> is hated and deſpiſed.

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is an <hi>univerſal</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which extendeth it ſelf to all the Commands of God alike, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the duties of both Tables, ſuch was the obedience of <hi>Caleb, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Lord fully,</hi> and of <hi>David who hadreſpct to all the commands.</hi>

               <p>He that thus obeys the Command of God is a Chriſtian indeed, a friend of Chriſt indeed, but all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the commands of God is not this obedience. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a partial obedience, a peece-meal Religion, when a man obeys God in one command and not another, own's him in one duty and not another, when a man ſeems to make conſcience of the duties of one Table, and not of the duties of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is the Religion of moſt.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:95530:90"/>
               <p>Now this obedience is no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for as he that doth not love God <hi>above all,</hi> doth not love God <hi>at all;</hi> ſo he that doth not obey <hi>all</hi> the commands <hi>univerſally,</hi> cannot be ſaid to obey <hi>any</hi> command <hi>truly.</hi> It is ſaid of thoſe in <hi>Samaria,</hi> that they <hi>feared the Lord, and ſerved their own Gods, after their own manner,</hi> 2 Kings 17.33. and yet in the very next verſe, it is ſaid, <hi>they feared not the Lord,</hi> ſo that their fear of the Lord was no fear: in like manner that obedience to God is no obedience which is but a partial and peice-meal obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A man may obey much, and yet be in his old nature, and if ſo, then all his obedience in that eſtate, is but <hi>Splendidum peccatum</hi> a painted ſin, <hi>he that offereth an oblation is as if he offered ſwines blood, and he that burneth incenſe as if he bleſſed an Idol.</hi> Iſa. 66.3. The nature muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed before the command can be rightly obeyed, for a <hi>corrupt tree can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring forth good fruit.</hi> Matth. 7.18.</p>
               <p>Whatever a mans performances <pb n="139" facs="tcp:95530:90"/>are, they cannot be called <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> whilſt the heart remaineth unregenerate, becauſe the <hi>principle</hi> is falſe and unſound; every duty done by a beleiver is accepted of God as a part of his obedience to the will of God, though it be done in much weakneſs, becauſe though the belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>hand</hi> is weak,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.6. Rom. 6.17.</note> yet his <hi>heart</hi> is right, the Hypocrite may have the moſt <hi>active hand,</hi> but the belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath the moſt <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>ſincere heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A man may obey the <hi>law,</hi> and yet have no love to the <hi>Law-giver;</hi> a carnal heart may do the command of God, but he cannot love God, and therefore cannot do it arigt, for love to God is the foundation and ſpring of all true obedience, every command of God is to be done in love, this is the fulfilling <hi>of the law,</hi> Rom. 13.10. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Though I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned;</hi> theſe ſeem to be acts of the higheſt obedience, yet <hi>if I have not love, it profits me nothing.</hi> 1 Cor. 13.3.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:95530:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="4">4. I might add, that a man may be much in obedience from finiſter and baſe ſelfiſh ends, as the <hi>Phariſes, prayed much, gave much alms, fasted much,</hi> but our Lord Chriſt tells us that it was <hi>that they might be ſeen of men, and have glory of men,</hi> Mat. 6.2, 5, 16. moſt of the Hypocrites piety, empties it ſelf into vain glory, and therefore he is but an <hi>empty vine</hi> in all he doth, becauſe <hi>he bringeth forth fruit to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> Hoſ. 10.1.</p>
               <p>It is the end that juſtifies the action, indeed a <hi>good end</hi> cannot make a <hi>bad action good,</hi> but yet the want of a <hi>good end,</hi> makes a <hi>good action bad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then if a man may obey the commands of God, partially and by halves, if he may do it, and yet be in his natural ſtate, if he may obey the commands of God, and yet not love God, if the ends of his obedience may be ſinful and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, then a man may be much in obeying the Commands of God, and yet be but <hi>almoſt a Chriſtian.</hi>

               <p n="20">20. And ſo I ſhall end this long purſuit of the almoſt Chriſtian in his progreſs Heaven-ward, with this one general concluſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A man may do all (as to external duties and worſhip) that a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an can, and when he hath done all, be but almoſt a Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You muſt know all the Commands of God have an <hi>intra</hi> and an <hi>extra,</hi> there is (as may ſay,) the body and the ſoul of the command.</p>
               <p>And accordingly there is an <hi>internal</hi> and an <hi>external</hi> worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>internal</hi> acts of worſhipping of God, are to love God, to fear God, to delight in God, to truſt in God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>external</hi> acts of Worſhipping God, are by praying, teaching, hearing, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now there is a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe internal and external acts of Worſhip, (and indeed ſuch a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is, that they diſtinguiſh the <hi>altogether,</hi> from the <hi>almoſt</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, <pb n="147" facs="tcp:95530:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>The ſincere beleiver from the unſound profeſſor; and indeed in this very thing, the main difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them doth lie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Internal</hi> acts of Worſhip are good, <hi>propter fieri,</hi> the goodneſs doth adhere intrinſecally to the thing done, a man cannot love God nor fear God, but it will be imputed to him for a gracious act, and a great part of his Holineſs.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>external</hi> acts of Worſhip, are not denominated good, ſo much from the matter done, <hi>propter fieri,</hi> as from the manner of doing them; a man cannot ſin in loving and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God, but he may ſin in praying and hearing &amp;c. for want of a due manner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Internal</hi> acts of worſhip put a goodneſs into <hi>external,</hi> it is our faith, our love, our fear of God, that makes our duties good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They better the heart, and greaten the degrees of a mans holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; external duties do not always do this, a man may pray, and yet his heart never the holier, he may <pb n="148" facs="tcp:95530:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>hear the word, and yet his heart never the ſofter; but now the more a man fears God, the wiſer he is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.7. the more a man loves God, the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he is; love is the perfection of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; we ſhall never be perfect in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, till we come to be perfect in love.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is ſuch an excellency in this <hi>internal</hi> worſhip, that he who mixes it with his <hi>external</hi> duties is a true Chriſtian when he doth leaſt; but without this mixture, he is but almoſt <hi>a Chriſtian,</hi> that doth moſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Internal</hi> acts of Worſhip, joyned with <hi>outward,</hi> ſanctifie them and make them <hi>accepted</hi> of God, though few; <hi>external</hi> acts of Worſhip without <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> make them abhorred of God, though they be <hi>never ſo many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that though the almoſt Chriſtian may do all thoſe duties in Hypocriſe, which a true Chriſtian doth in <hi>ſincerity,</hi> nay though in doing <hi>external</hi> duties, he may out-do the true Chriſtian, (as the comet makes a greater blaze then the true Stars; if <hi>Eliah</hi> faſt and mourn, <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts will cut their fleſh.)</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:95530:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Yet he cannot do thoſe <hi>internal</hi> duties that the meaneſt true Chriſtian can.</p>
               <p>The almoſt Chriſtian can pray, but he cannot love God, he can teach or hear, &amp;c. but he cannot take delight in God.</p>

               <p>Oh therefore let not any weak beleiver, be diſcouraged, though Hypocrites may out-do them, and go beyond them in duty, for all their duties are done in Hypocriſie, but your faith and love to God in duties, is a proof of your ſincerity.</p>

                  <hi>Why or whence is it that many men go ſo far as that they come to be almoſt Chriſtians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It may be to anſwer the call of conſcience,</hi> though few men have grace, yet all men have conſcience.</p>
               <p>Now do but obſerve, and you ſhall ſee how far conſcience may go in this work.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſcience owns a God, and that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95530:98"/>this God muſt be worſhipped and ſerved by the creature,</hi> Atheiſts in practice we have many, ſuch as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. <hi>They profeſs they know God, but in works they deny him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Atheiſts in judgment none can be, <hi>Tully</hi> a Heathen could ſay, <hi>nulla gens tam barbara,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now their being ſuch a light in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as to diſcover that their is a God, and that he muſt be Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; by the help of farther light, the light of the word, a man may be inabled to do much in the ways of God, and yet his heart without a dram of grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Know this, <hi>that natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is capable of great improvements from the means of grace;</hi> ſitting under the ordinances, may exceedingly heighten the indowments of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; though they do not ſanctifie conſcience, it may be much <hi>regulated;</hi> though it be not at all <hi>renewed,</hi> it may be <hi>inlightned; convinced,</hi> and yet never <hi>ſavingly converted</hi> and <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi>

It could not be a ſaving work, a true change and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſtate, for notwithſtanding this inlightning, and <hi>taſting,</hi> and <hi>partaking,</hi> yet they are here ſaid <hi>to fall away,</hi> v. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 22.32.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 33.27.</note>Had it been a true work of grace, they could never have fallen away from that, a beleiver may fall, but he cannot <hi>fall away;</hi> he may <hi>fall foully,</hi> but he can never <hi>fall finally,</hi> for <hi>underneath are the everlaſting arms;</hi> his faith is eſtabliſhed in the ſtrength of that prayer of Chriſt, that our <hi>faith fail not,</hi> nay he tels us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that it is <hi>eternal life</hi> which he gives, from which we <hi>ſhall never periſh,</hi> John 10.28.</p>
               <p>This work then here ſpoken of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any ſaving work, becauſe it is not an <hi>abiding</hi> work, for they that are under it, are ſaid to fall away from it; but though it be not a ſaving work, yet it is a <hi>ſupernatural</hi> work, it is an improvement made by the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95530:99"/>word upon the conſciences of men through the power of the Spirit; and therefore they are ſaid <hi>to taſt the good word of God,</hi> and to be made <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> they have not the ſpirit abiding in them <hi>ſavingly,</hi> but ſtriving with them, and working upon them <hi>convincingly,</hi> to the awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening and ſetting conſcience on work. And conſcience thus ſtirred may carry a man very far in Religion, and in the duties of the Goſpel, and yet be but a <hi>natural</hi> conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A common work</hi> of the ſpirit may ſtead a man very much in the duties of Religion, though it muſt be a <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial work</hi> of the ſpirit that ſteads a man to ſalvation, a man may have the <hi>aſſiſting preſence</hi> of the ſpirit inabling him to preach and pray, and yet he may periſh for want of the <hi>renewing preſence</hi> of the ſpirit, inabling him to beleive, <hi>Judas</hi> had the former, and yet periſhed for want of the latter, he had the ſpirit aſſiſting him to caſt out devils, but yet he had not the ſpirit <hi>renewing</hi> him, for he was caſt out himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:95530:99"/>
               <p>Thus a man may have an <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> conſcience, and yet be a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to a <hi>renewed</hi> conſcience; and conſcience thus improved, may put a man very much upon duty.</p>
               <p>I pray God none of us miſtake a conſcience thus <hi>improved</hi> by the word, for a conſcience <hi>renewed</hi> by the ſpirit, the miſtake is very eaſie, eſpecially when a life of duties is the fruit of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The conſcience of a natural man is ſubject to diſtreſs and trouble,</hi> though a natural conſcience is not <hi>ſanctified</hi> with grace, yet it is often <hi>troubled</hi> at ſin, trouble of conſcience is not inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to beleivers onely, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to unbeleivers alſo. A beleivers conſcience, is ſometimes troubled when his ſin is truely pardoned, and a natural mans conſcience is troubled <hi>for</hi> ſin, though it is never freed <hi>from</hi> ſin. God ſometimes ſets the word home upon the ſinners conſcience and applies the terrours of the law to it, and this fills the ſoul with fear and horrour, of death, and hell, now in this caſe the ſoul uſually betakes it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95530:100"/>ſelf to a life of duties, meerly to fence trouble out of conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 14.30, 31.</note>When <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſets fire on <hi>Joabs</hi> corn fields, then he runs to him, though he refuſed before, ſo when God lets a ſpark of Hell (as it were) fall upon the ſinners conſcience in applying the terrours of the word, this drives the ſinner to a life of duties, which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver minded before; The ground of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a mans ingaging in Religion, is the trouble of his conſcience, and the end of his continuing in Religion is the quieting of conſcience; if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would never check him, God ſhould never from him.</p>
               <p>Natural conſcience hath a voice, and ſpeaks aloud many times in the ſinners ears, and telleth him, this ought not to be done, God muſt not be forgotten, the commands of God ought not to be ſlighted, living in ſin will be the ruine of the ſoul, and hence it is that a natural man runs to duties, and takes up a lifeleſs and graceleſs profeſſion that he may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſilence conſcience.</p>
               <p>As a man ſick in his ſtomack, what <pb n="159" facs="tcp:95530:100"/>ever ſweet morſel he hath eaten, he brings up all; and although it was <hi>ſweet</hi> in the eating, yet it is bitter in the riſing.</p>
               <p>So it fareth with the ſinner, when he is Sermon-ſick, or Conſcience-ſick, though his ſin was ſweet in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, yet the thought of it riſeth bitter upon the conſcience, and then his profeſſion of religion is the pill he rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth about in his mouth, to take away the bitterneſs of-ſins taſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Natural conſcience inlightned by the word may diſcover to a man much of the miſery of a natural ſtate,</hi> though not effectually to bring him out of it, yet ſo as to make him reſtleſs and weary in it; it may ſhew a ſinner his nakedneſs, and hereupon the ſoul runneth to a life of duties, thinking hereby to ſtead the miſery of his caſe, and to make a covering for his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs. It is ſaid <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. That when <hi>Adam and Eve ſaw they were naked, they ſewed Fig leaves together and made themſelvelves a covering.</hi> So when once the ſinner ſeeth his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs and vileneſs by reaſon of ſin,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95530:101"/>whereas he ſhould run to Chriſt, and cloſe with him, and beg his righteouſneſs for a covering, <hi>that the ſhame of his nakedneſs do not appear,</hi> Rev. 3.18. he rather runneth to a life of duties and performances, and thus maketh himſelf a covering wlth the <hi>fig-leaves</hi> of a profeſſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt truely imbraced, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience at all renewed.</p>
               <p>Naural man would fain be his own Saviour, and ſupoſeth a change of ſtate to be a thing within his own power, and that the true work of grace lieth in leaving off the practiſe of fin, and taking up a life of duties, and therefore upon this principle doth many a graceleſs profeſſour outſtrip a ſound beleiver, for he reſteth in his own performances, and hopeth theſe will commend him to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Queſt."/> If <hi>a natural conſcience may go thus far, then what difference is there between this natural conſcience in Hypocrites and ſinners, and a renewed conſcience in beleivers?</hi> or how may I know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the workings of my conſcience
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95530:101"/>be the workings of nature onely, or elſe of grace wrought in it.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               </p>
               <p>Now it is very incident to a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſcience, to miſgive and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt its ſtate, upon the fight of any ſin; when he ſees Hypocriſie break out in any duty or performance, then he complaines ſurely my aims are not ſincere, my conſcience is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, it is but natural conſcience <hi>inlightened,</hi> not by grace <hi>purged and changed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It ariſeth from that reſemblance there is between <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> for <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> is a <hi>reſemblance</hi> of grace <pb n="162" facs="tcp:95530:102"/>

               <p>But to anſwer the Queſtion, you may make a judgement of this in theſe ſeven particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If a natural mans conſcience, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him upon duty, he doth uſually bound himſelf in the Work of God:</hi> his duties are limited, his obedience is a limited obedience, he doth one duty and neglecteth another, he pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and chuſeth among the Commands of God, obeyeth one and ſlighteth another.

                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 119.20</note>But now where Conſcience is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by grace, there it is otherwiſe; Though there may be many weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which accompanie its duties, yet that ſoul never bounds it ſelf in working after God, it never <hi>loves</hi> God <hi>ſo much</hi> but ſtill it would love him <hi>more,</hi> nor <hi>ſeeks</hi> him <hi>ſo much,</hi> but ſtill it would <hi>ſeek him more,</hi> nor doth it <hi>ſerve</hi> God <hi>ſo well</hi> at any time, but ſtill it makes conſcience of ſerving him better. <hi>A renewed conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a ſpring of univerſal obedience, Pſal.</hi> 119.128. for it ſeeth an <hi>infinite excellency,</hi> and <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in God, and therefore would fain have its ſervice riſe up towards ſome proportionableneſs to the object; a God of infinite excellency and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhould have infinite love ſaith Conſcience, a holy God ſhould have ſervice from a holy heart ſaith conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ro. 2.14.</note>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I had not known ſin, but by the Law, Rom.</hi> 7.7.

And indeed this is a diſcovery proper to the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>It is he that makes the ſinner ſee all the deformity and filthineſs that is within, it is he that pulleth off all the

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Natural convictions carry the Soul out to look more on the evil that comes by ſin, then on the evil that is in ſin;</hi> ſo that the ſoul under this conviction is more troubled at the dread of Hell and wrath, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, then at the vileneſs and hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous nature of ſin.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Spiritual convictions,</hi> work the ſoul into a greater ſenſibleneſs of the evil that is in ſin, then of the evil that comes by ſin, the <hi>diſhonour</hi> done to God by walking contrary to his will, the <hi>wounds</hi> that are made in the heart of Chriſt, the greif that the holy Spirit of God is put to, this wounds the ſoul more then a thouſand Hells.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Natural convictions are not dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they are quickly worn out,</hi> they <pb n="186" facs="tcp:95530:114"/>are like a <hi>ſlight cut</hi> in the skin, that bleeds a little, and is ſoar for the preſent, but is healed again, and in a few days not ſo much as a Scar to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Spiritual convictions</hi> are durable, they cannot be worn out, they abide in the ſoul till they have reached their end (which is the change of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)</p>
               <p>The <hi>convictions</hi> of the ſpirit are like a <hi>deep wound</hi> in the fleſh, that goes to the bone, and ſeems to indanger the life of the Patient, and is not heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but with great skill; and when it is healed, leaves a Scar behinde it, that when the Patient is well, yet he can ſay, here is the mark of my wound, which will never wear out.</p>

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Natural convictions make the Soul ſhy of God,</hi> guilt works fear, and fear cauſes eſtrangedneſs; thus it was with <hi>Adam,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Ier. 31.18</note>Now ſpiritual convictions drive not the ſoul from God, but unto God; <hi>Ephraims</hi> conviction was ſpiritual, and he runs to God, <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned.</hi> So that there is you ſee, a great difference between <hi>conviction</hi> and <hi>conviction,</hi> between that which is <hi>natural,</hi> and that which is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> that which is <hi>Common,</hi> and that which is <hi>Saving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea ſuch is the difference, that though a man hath never ſo much of the former, yet if he be without the latter, he is but <hi>almoſt a Chriſtian,</hi> and therefore we have great reaſon to inquire more after this ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. For,</p>

               <p>Till the ſinner be convinced of ſin, he can never be converted from ſin, Chriſts coming was as a Saviour, to dye for ſinners, and the ſpirits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is to convince us as ſinners, that we may cloſe with Chriſt as a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; till ſin be throughly <hi>diſcovered to us,</hi> intereſt in the blood of Chriſt, cannot rightly be <hi>claimed by us,</hi> nay ſo long as ſin is <hi>unſeen,</hi> Chriſt will be <hi>unſought.

               <p>Here you have an account of the different apprehenſions <hi>Paul</hi> had of his condition, with and without the word.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ro. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>and of the truth of the law,</hi> therefore when he ſaith, he was <hi>without the law,</hi> you muſt not take him literally, but ſpiritually, he was without the power and efficacy of it upon his heart and conſcience, convincing and awakening, and diſcovering ſin, and ſo long as this was his caſe, he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not of his ſtate, he was confident of the goodneſs of his condition, this he hinteth when he ſayth, <hi>I was alive,</hi> but then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is his apprehenſion of his condition with the word, and that is quite contrary to what it was before, <pb n="201" facs="tcp:95530:121"/>
                  <hi>when the commandment came</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>then ſin revived and I dyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Word of the Lord came with power upon his ſoul, when the Spirit of God, ſet it home effectually upon his conſcience, that is meant <hi>by the coming of the Commandment; then ſin revived and I dyed,</hi> that is, I ſaw the deſperateneſs of my caſe, and the filthineſs of all my ſelf righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Then my hope ceaſed, and my confidence failed, and as before I thought my <hi>ſelf alive,</hi> and my <hi>ſin dead,</hi> ſo when God had awakened conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by the Word, then I ſaw my <hi>ſin alive and powerful,</hi> and my <hi>ſelf dead and miſerable.</hi>

It is no advantage to the ſoul to be <hi>almoſt converted;</hi> for the little that we want, ſpoils the good of all our attainments; We ſay, as good never a whit as never the near, <hi>ad nihilum valet quod non valet ad finem ſuum:</hi> there is no profit in leaving this or that ſin, unleſs we leave all ſin; <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John</hi> gladly, and did many things, but he kept his <hi>Herodias,</hi> and that ruined him. <hi>Judas</hi> did many things, prayed much, preached much, profeſſed much, but yet his covetouſneſs ſpoiled all; one ſin ruined the young man, that had kept all the Commands but one. Thus he <hi>that offends in one point is guilty of all.</hi> That is, that lives willingly and allowedly in any one ſin, he brings the guilt of the violation of the whole Law of God upon his ſoul, and that upon a twofold account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe he manifeſts the ſame contempt of the Authority of God, <pb n="229" facs="tcp:95530:135"/>in the wilful breach of one, as of all.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

And for this cauſe the leaſt ſin willingly, and with allowance lived in, ſpoils the good of all our obedience, and lays the ſoul under the whole wrath of God. One leak in a Ship may ſink her, though ſhe be tite every where elſe; <hi>Gideon</hi> had <hi>ſeven Sons,</hi>

               <p>How uncomfortable then muſt that condition needs be wherein a man is abhorred both of God and man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is uncomfortable in regard of ſufferings;</hi> for being <hi>almost a Chriſtian,</hi> will bring us into ſuffering, but being <hi>but almoſt a Chriſtian,</hi> will never car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us through ſuffering, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20, 21.

               </p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:95530:136"/>
               <p>There are four things obſervable in the Words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the ſtony ground may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word with joy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it may for ſome time abide in a profeſſion of it, <hi>he dureth for a while.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That this profeſſion will expoſe to ſuffering; for mark, perſecution is ſaid to ariſe becauſe of the Word.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This ſuffering will cauſe an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatizing from profeſſion, for that which is here called offence, is in <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.13. called falling away, <hi>which for a while beleive, and in time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation fall away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I gather hence, a profeſſion may expoſe a man as much to ſuffering, as the power of godlineſs; but without the power of godlineſs there is no holding out in a profeſſion, under ſuffering. The World hates the <hi>ſhew</hi> of godlineſs, and therefore perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes it, <hi>the almoſt Chriſtian</hi> wants the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and therefore cannot hold out in it</p>
               <p>Now this muſt needs be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable; if I profeſs Religion, I am like to ſuffer; if I do but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs <pb n="232" facs="tcp:95530:137"/>it, I am never like to indure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is uncomfortable in regard of that deceit it lays our hopes under;</hi> to be deceived of our hopes, cauſeth ſorrow as well as ſhame; he that is but <hi>almoſta hriſtian,</hi> hopes for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but unleſs he be <hi>altogether a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> he ſhall never come there.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 25.10.</note>Now to periſh with hope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to go to Hell by the gates of glory, to come to the very door, and then be ſhut out, as the <hi>five Virgins</hi> were, to dy in the Wilderneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight of the promiſed land, at the very brinks of <hi>Jordan,</hi> this muſt needs be ſad, to come within a ſtride of the Goal and miſs it, to ſink with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight of harbour; Oh how uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable is this?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>As it is greatly unprofitable, and exceedingly uncomfortable, to be but almoſt a Chriſtian, ſo it is deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous.</hi> For,</p>

This I gather from that parable of the <hi>two Sons</hi> which our Lord Chriſt urged to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing <hi>Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> Mat.<note place="margin">Mat. 21.28, 29.30, 31.</note> 21.28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There was a man had two Sons, and he came to one and ſaid gowork to day in my Vineyard; He ſaid, I will not, but afterwards repented and went.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he came to the ſecond, and ſaid likewiſe; and he ſaid, I go Sir, but went not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt repreſents the carnal open ſinner, that is called by the word, but refuſes, yet afterwards repents and beleives. The ſecond repreſents the Hypocritical profeſſor, that pretends much, but performes little; Now mark how Chriſt applies this Parable, <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that the Publicans and the Harlots, go into the Kingdom of God before you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And upon this account it is better not to be at all, then to be almoſt a Chriſtian, for the almoſt hinders the altogether. It is better (in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard) to be a ſinner without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, then to be a profeſſor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <pb n="234" facs="tcp:95530:138"/>out converſion, for the one lies fairer for an inward change, when the other reſts in an outward. Our Lord Chriſt tels the <hi>Scribe,</hi> Mar. 12.34. <hi>Thou art not far from the Kingdom of God,</hi> and yet never like to come there. None farther from the Kingdom of God, then ſuch as are not far from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. As for inſtance, when there lies but one luſt, one ſin between a ſoul and Chriſt, that ſoul is not far from Chriſt, but now when the ſoul reſts in this nearneſs to Chriſt, and yet will not part with that one luſt for Chriſt, but thinks his condition ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, though that luſt be not ſubdued, who is farther from the Kingdom of God then he?</p>
               <p>So our Lord Chriſt tells the young man, <hi>Mar.</hi> 20.21. <hi>One thing thou lackeſt,</hi> why he was very neer Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, near being a Chriſtian altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was almoſt ſaved, he tells Chriſt he had kept all the Commands, <hi>v.</hi> 20. He lacked but <hi>one thing;</hi> I ſay, but one thing, but it was a great thing, that <hi>one thing</hi> he lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was more then <hi>all things</hi> he had, <pb n="235" facs="tcp:95530:138"/>for it was the one <hi>thing neceſſary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lu. 10.42</note> it was a new heart, a work of grace in his ſoul, a change of ſtate, a heart weaned from the world, I, this was the one thing and he that lacks this one thing, periſhes with his all things elſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2, <hi>This condition is ſo like a ſtate of grace, that the miſtake of it for grace is eaſie and common;</hi> and it is very dangerous to miſtake any thing for grace, that is not grace, for in that a man contents himſelf, as if it were grace. <hi>Formality</hi> doth often dwell next door to <hi>ſincerity,</hi> and one ſign ſerves both, and ſo the houſe may be eaſily miſtaken, and by that means a man may take up his lodging there, and never find the way out again.</p>
               <p>What one ſaith of Wiſdom, <hi>Multi ad ſapientiam perveniſſent, niſi ſe jam perveniſſe putaſſent,</hi> many might have been wiſe, had they not thought themſelves ſo, when they were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; The ſame I may ſay of grace, many a formal profeſſor might have been a ſincere beleiver, had he not miſtook his profeſſion for converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <pb n="236" facs="tcp:95530:139"/>his duties for graces, and ſo reſted in that for ſincerity, which is but Hypocriſie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is a degree of blaſphemy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to grace, and yet have no grace,</hi> I gather this from that <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.9. <hi>I know the blaſphemy of them which ſay they are Jews and are not.</hi> This place under-goes varieties of conſtructions, <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Pareus,</hi> do not make their blaſphemy to lye in their ſaying, <hi>they are Jews and are not;</hi> but to lye in the reproaches that theſe <hi>Jews</hi> faſtened upon Chriſt, calling him <hi>impoſter, deceiver, one that hath a Devil;</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note>
                  <hi>Bright-man</hi> goes another way, and ſaith, this was the blaſphemy of theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> they retained that way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that was abrogated; and thruſt upon God thoſe old <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt had aboliſhed, <hi>and nailed to his proſs,</hi> by which they overthrew the glory of Chriſt, and denyed his comming. So that the retaining of Altar-Worſhip, and the reſt of the Levitical Ceremonies in Goſpel Churches, is in <hi>Bright-mans</hi> 
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:95530:139"/>ſenſe, a denying Chriſt is come, and conſequently a degree of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ro. 2.29.</note>But I conceive the blaſphemy of theſe Jews to lye in this, that <hi>they ſaid they were Jews and were not.</hi> A Jew here is not to be taken litterally and ſtrictly onely, for one of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but it is to be taken <hi>Metonymically,</hi> for a true Beleiver, one of the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham; He is a Jew which is one inwardly;</hi> ſo that for a man to ſay he is a Jew when he is not, to profeſs an intereſt in Chriſt when he hath none, to ſay he hath grace when he hath none, this Chriſt calls Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould Chriſt call this <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy?</hi> this is <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> but how may it be ſaid to be <hi>Blaſphemy?</hi> Why? he blaſphemes the great Attribute of <hi>Gods Omniſciency;</hi> he doth implicitly denie that God ſees and knows our hearts and thoughts; for if a man did beleeve the Omniſciency of God, that he ſearches the heart, and ſees, and knows all within. He would not dare to reſt in a graceleſs profeſſion <pb n="238" facs="tcp:95530:140"/>of godlineſs; this therefore is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe my in the account of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It is dangerous to be almoſt a Chriſtian, in that this ſtills, and ſerves to quiet conſcience.</hi> Now it is very dangerous to quiet conſcience,<note place="margin">— Bello pax ca deterior.</note> with any thing but the blood of Chriſt; It is bad being at peace, till Chriſt ſpeaks peace, nothing can truely pacifie conſcience, leſs then that which pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies God, and that is the blood of the Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now the almoſt Chriſtian quiets conſcience, but not with the blood of Chriſt, it is not a peace flowing from Chriſts <hi>propitiation,</hi> but a peace riſing from a <hi>formal profeſſion,</hi> not a peace of Chriſts giving, but a peace of his own making; He ſilences and bribes conſcience, with a forme of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo makes it give way to an undoing, foul deſtroying peace; he rocks it aſleep in the Cradle of duties, and then it is a thouſand to one, it never awaketh more till death or judgment.</p>
               <p>Ah my brethren it is better to have conſcience never quiet, then quieted <pb n="239" facs="tcp:95530:140"/>any way but by <hi>the blood of Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> a good conſcience unquiet is the greateſt affliction to Saints, and an evil conſcience quiet is the greateſt judgment to ſinners.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Alaſs! It is an <hi>infinite righteouſneſs</hi> that muſt ſatisfie for us, for it is an <hi>infinite God,</hi> that is offended by us. If ever thy ſin be pardoned it is <hi>infinite mercy</hi> that muſt pardon it, if ever thou be reconciled to God, it is <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite merit</hi> muſt do it; if ever thy heart be changed, and thy ſtate renewed, it is <hi>infinite power muſt effect</hi> it; and if ever thy ſoul eſcape hell, and be ſaved at laſt, it is <hi>infinite grace muſt</hi> ſave it.</p>
               <p>In theſe three things right and ſound conviction lieth. And wherever the Spirit of God worketh theſe through convictions, it is in order to a true and ſound converſion. For by this means the ſoul is brought under a right qualification for the receiving Chriſt.</p>
               <p>You muſt know, that a ſinner, <hi>quatenus</hi> a ſinner, can never come to Chriſt, for he is dead in ſin, in enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt Chriſt, an enemy to God, <pb n="278" facs="tcp:95530:160"/>and the grace of God; but there are certain qualifications that come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſouls dead ſtate in ſin, and the work of converſion and cloſing with Chriſt,<note place="margin">Se Nortons Orthod. Fvangeliſt p. <hi>130.</hi>
                  </note> whereby the ſoul is put into a capacity of receiving the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. For no man is brought immediately out of his dead ſtate, and made to beleive in Jeſus Chriſt. There are <hi>termini mediantes,</hi> ſome qualifications comming in between; now ſound convictions are the right qualifications, for the ſinners receiving Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.12.13.</note> 
                  <hi>for he came not to call the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but ſinners to repentance;</hi> that is, ſuch as ſee themſelves ſinners, and thereby in a loſt condition; ſo <hi>Luke</hi> explains it, <hi>The ſon of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt;</hi>

               <p>Oh therefore if you would be ſound Chriſtians, get ſound convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ask thoſe that are beleivers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and they will tell you, had it not been for their convictions, they had never ſought after Chriſt fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>till they end in converſion:</hi> this is that wherein moſt men miſcarry, they reſt in their convictions, and take them for converſion; as if ſin ſeen were therefore forgiven, or as if a ſight of the want of grace, were the truth of the work of grace.</p>
               <p>That is a notable place in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Ephraim is an unwiſe Son, for he ſhould not ſtay long in the place of the breaking forth of Children.</hi> The place of the breaking forth of Children is the Womb; as the child comes out of the womb, ſo is converſion born out of the womb of conviction. Now when the child ſticks between the Womb and the World, it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, it hazard's the life both of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Child; ſo when a ſinner reſts <pb n="280" facs="tcp:95530:161"/>in conviction, and goes no farther but ſticks <hi>in the place of the breaking forth of Children,</hi> this is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and hazards the life of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>You that are at any time under convictions; Oh take heed of reſting in them, do not <hi>ſtay long in the place of the breaking forth of children;</hi> though it is true that conviction is the firſt ſtep to converſion, yet it is not converſion; a man may carry his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions along with him into hell.</p>
               <p>What is that which troubleth poor creatures when they come to dye, but this, I have not improved my convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; at ſuch a time I was convinced of ſin, but yet I went on in ſin, in the face of my convictions; in ſuch a Sermon I was convined of ſuch a duty, but I ſlighted the conviction; I was convinced of my want of Chriſt, and of the readineſs of Chriſt to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſave, but alaſs I followed not the conviction.</p>
               <p>My brethren remember this, ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed convictions are the worſt death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed companions. There are two <pb n="281" facs="tcp:95530:161"/>things eſpecially which above all others make a death-bed very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</p>

               <p>Now therefore, hath the Spirit of the Lord been at work in your ſouls? have you ever been convinced of the evil of ſin, of the miſery of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural eſtate, of the inſufficiency of all things under Heaven, to help, of the fulneſs and righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, of the neceſſity of and reſting upon him for pardon and peace, for ſanctification and ſalvation? have you ever been really convinced of theſe things? Oh then! as you love your own ſouls, as ever you hope to be ſaved at laſt, and injoy God for ever, improve theſe
